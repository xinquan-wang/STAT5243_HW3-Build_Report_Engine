# Building a Reporting Engine
All of the previous homework assignments have asked you to perform analyses while writing a report. This time, you will build a dynamic reporting system that can display a wider range of information. Each of the questions below will include an analytical component. Then you will build a section of a reporting engine that can answer a whole class of similar questions.

The analytical questions may be written up in the usual style of a report. We will also ask you to turn in your reporting engine as an RMarkdown file.
